# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Honestly, the syntax exercise through me for a loop. Also, I find myself going down rabbit holes that are often simple solutions.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Note taking goes slowly so far, it usually happens after the exercise as I am going back through. Very time consuming.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I tend to mess with the code and play around for a little bit before googling.
